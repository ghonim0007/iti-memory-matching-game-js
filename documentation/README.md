## **3. Technologies Used üíª**

- **HTML5**: Used for structuring the game pages and elements.
- **CSS3**: Used for styling, animations, and responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: Used for game logic, interactivity, and dynamic content updates.
- **Web Audio API**: Used for playing sound effects and background music.
- **LocalStorage**: Used for saving and retrieving high scores.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures the game works on all screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).

---

## **4. Game Logic and Flow üß†**

### **Game Flow**
1. **Start Screen**: Players choose a difficulty level (Easy, Medium, Hard).
2. **Gameplay**:
   - Players flip two cards at a time to find matching pairs.
   - The game tracks the number of moves and time taken.
   - Players can use hints to reveal unmatched cards temporarily.
3. **Game Over**:
   - When all pairs are matched, the game ends.
   - Players can save their score and view high scores.

### **Core Logic**
- **Card Matching**: Cards are shuffled and displayed in a grid. Players flip cards to find matching pairs.
- **Hint System**: Players can use hints to reveal unmatched cards for a limited time.
- **Timer**: A timer tracks the time taken to complete the level.
- **High Scores**: Scores are saved in `localStorage` and displayed in a high-score table.

---

## **5. JavaScript Concepts and Methods üõ†Ô∏è**

### **Key JavaScript Concepts**
1. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**:
   - The game logic is encapsulated in the `GameLogic` class.
   - Methods like `start()`, `generateCards()`, and `checkForMatch()` handle game functionality.

2. **Event Handling**:
   - Event listeners are used for card clicks, button clicks, and user interactions.
   - Example: `card.addEventListener('click', () => this.handleCardClick(card));`

3. **DOM Manipulation**:
   - The game dynamically updates the DOM to reflect card flips, moves, and timer.
   - Example: `document.getElementById('moves').textContent = this.moves;`

4. **LocalStorage**:
   - High scores are saved and retrieved using `localStorage`.
   - Example: `localStorage.setItem('highScores_easy', JSON.stringify(scores));`

5. **Asynchronous Programming**:
   - Assets are preloaded asynchronously using `fetch` and `Promise`.
   - Example: `await preloadAssets(selectedDifficulty);`

6. **Animations**:
   - CSS animations are triggered using JavaScript for card flips, shuffling, and hints.
   - Example: `card.classList.add('flipped');`

### **Key Methods**
- **`GameLogic.start()`**: Initializes the game, generates cards, and starts the timer.
- **`GameLogic.generateCards()`**: Creates a shuffled array of card values.
- **`GameLogic.checkForMatch()`**: Checks if two flipped cards match.
- **`GameLogic.endGame()`**: Handles game-over logic, saves scores, and displays results.
- **`initializeHint()`**: Manages the hint system and updates the hint counter.
- **`preloadAssets()`**: Preloads all assets (images, audio) before starting the game.

---

## **6. HTML Structure üèóÔ∏è**

### **Main Page (`index.html`)**
- Contains the start screen with difficulty selection and high-score viewing.
- Uses popup modals for "How to Play" and "High Scores".

### **Level Pages (`easy.html`, `medium.html`, `hard.html`)**
- Each page has a grid of cards, a timer, a moves counter, and a hint button.
- The grid size varies based on the difficulty level.

### **Popup Modals**
- Used for displaying instructions, high scores, and game-over messages.

---

## **7. CSS Styling and Animations üé®**

### **Key CSS Features**
1. **Responsive Design**:
   - Media queries ensure the game works on all screen sizes.
   - Example:
     ```css
     @media (max-width: 768px) {
       .card-grid {
         grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 100px);
       }
     }
     ```

2. **Animations**:
   - Card flips, shuffling, and hint animations are implemented using CSS keyframes.
   - Example:
     ```css
     @keyframes flip {
       0% { transform: rotateY(0deg); }
       100% { transform: rotateY(180deg); }
     }
     ```

3. **Retro Styling**:
   - The game uses pixelated fonts and retro-inspired buttons.
   - Example:
     ```css
     .eightbit-btn {
       font-family: 'Press Start 2P', cursive;
       background: #fda032;
       box-shadow: inset -4px -4px 0px 0px #632607;
     }
     ```

4. **Progress Bar**:
   - A progress bar shows the time remaining for hints.
   - Example:
     ```css
     .progress-bar {
       width: 0%;
       height: 100%;
       background: linear-gradient(90deg, #ffc400, #ff3c00);
     }
     ```

---

## **8. Asset Management üì¶**

### **Asset Preloading**
- Assets (images, audio) are preloaded before the game starts to ensure smooth gameplay.
- The `preload.js` module handles asset preloading using `fetch` and `Promise`.

### **Asset Manifest (`assets.json`)**
- Contains paths to all assets (images, audio) for each level.
- Example:
  ```json
  {
    "easy": {
      "audio": {
        "backgroundMusic": "assets/easy/audio/background-music.mp3"
      },
      "images": {
        "cards": [
          "assets/easy/images/card1.png",
          "assets/easy/images/card2.png"
        ]
      }
    }
  }
  ```

---

## **9. Sound and Music üéµ**

### **Sound Effects**
- Click sounds, match sounds, and wrong sounds are played during gameplay.
- The `gameSound.js` module manages sound playback.

### **Background Music**
- Background music plays during gameplay and can be toggled on/off in the settings.

---

## **10. High Score System üèÜ**

### **Saving Scores**
- Scores are saved in `localStorage` and include the number of moves and time taken.
- Example:
  ```javascript
  localStorage.setItem('highScores_easy', JSON.stringify(scores));
  ```

### **Retrieving Scores**
- High scores are retrieved and displayed in a table on the high-scores popup.

---

## **11. Responsive Design üì±**

### **Media Queries**
- The game uses media queries to adjust the layout for different screen sizes.
- Example:
  ```css
  @media (max-width: 480px) {
    .card-grid {
      grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 90px);
    }
  }
  ```

---

## **12. Future Improvements üöÄ**

1. **Multiplayer Mode**: Add a multiplayer mode where players can compete in real-time.
2. **Themes**: Allow players to choose different themes (e.g., space, animals, sports).
3. **Leaderboard**: Implement an online leaderboard to track global high scores.
4. **More Levels**: Add additional levels with unique challenges.
